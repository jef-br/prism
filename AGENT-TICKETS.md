# PRISM Agent Tickets

Main thread is the orchestrator: owns ticket status, final integration, conflict resolution, and user-facing summaries.

## Team Rules

- Do not revert or overwrite edits made by other agents.
- Stay inside the ownership and write scope stated on your ticket.
- Read `jb/docs/PRISM-index.md` first; load only docs relevant to the ticket.
- Preserve pipeline order: Imported → Classified → Matched → Ordered → Renamed → Generated → Transformed → Exported.
- Do not advance past a milestone until its gate is documented and passed.
- Unresolved product decisions stay in folder-local `jbtodo.md` files — do not guess policy.

## Agent Reporting Protocol

- Report: ticket ID, changed files, commands run, pass/fail results, blockers, assumptions, next ticket.
- If blocked: stop, ask the orchestrator one targeted question — never ask the user directly.
- If work is found outside ticket scope: report a follow-up ticket, do not edit out of scope.
- Do not self-start the next ticket; orchestrator reviews completed work first.

## Orchestrator Handoff Protocol

- Satisfactory → mark `Done`.
- Incomplete but salvageable → correction to same agent or follow-up ticket.
- Missing product intent → ask user, then unblock agent.
- Milestone gates are authoritative: later tickets stay blocked until the gate passes.

## Ticket Format

Status: Ready, Blocked, Active, Review, Done. Agent type: `explorer`, `worker`, or orchestrator.

### T-2600 · M5 Classify groundwork
**Status:** Blocked | **Profile:** P0-orchestrator  
**Blocked-by:** M5 milestone gate — all Classify `jbtodo.md` decisions must be answered first.

Tracks the five open items in `jb/src/core/Images/Classify/jbtodo.md`:
1. Gate phenotypes (bypass flag — stays open until phenotypes validated).
2. Confirm ImageNGP taxonomy: `ImageNGP.json` ↔ `imagePhenotypes.md` ↔ `ImageRoles.json` agree on 26 phenotypes and their IF combinations.
3. Resolve `illustration-technical-drawing` scope (option (b) = null/no-phenotype recommended).
4. Replace `RecordUnknownFeatures()` stub with real CLIP measurements (after taxonomy + prompts are settled).
5. Phenotype production validation: labeled set, confusion matrix, <5% misassignment rate across 26 phenotypes.

M5 gate condition: all Classify decisions answered; ONNX session migrated to singleton.

### T-2820 · Ordered stage assigns non-deterministic det-slots for tied images within a family
**Status:** Ready | **Profile:** P1-feature-worker
**Found by:** [[T-2800]] end-to-end verification (2026-07-02).

**Problem:** Running `pwsh test/ci/Invoke-CiPipeline.ps1 -Mode Full -Dataset CiMini` three times back-to-back against the same unchanged build produced three different det-slot assignments for images tied within a family. Family `94613033` (`Pareo Exotica.jpg`, `Pareo_exotica_F1.jpg`, `Pareo_exotica_F2.jpg`) assigned `Pareo_exotica_F1.jpg` to det10, then det8, then det9 across three consecutive runs with no code change in between; family `90861083` (`23211008_02_A.jpg`/`_B.jpg`) flip-flopped between det8/det9. This makes any `expected-manifest.json` golden-file test unsafe for a family with more than one image sharing the same ImageRole/precedence tier, since there is no single correct "expected" det-slot to pin.

**Evidence:** 3 consecutive runs (2026-07-02), same build, same input, same API process — det-slot assignment for tied images changed every run. The `Ordered` stage runs before `Transformed` in the immutable pipeline order (Imported → Classified → Matched → **Ordered** → Renamed → Generated → **Transformed** → Exported), which rules out [[T-2800]]'s Transform/Upscale fix as the cause — `Ordered` output cannot depend on a later stage's behavior or timing.

**Root cause (untriaged):** `MatchingService.BuildLambda`'s `Parallel.For` results are explicitly re-aggregated in original input order ("Aggregate into ordered collections (single-threaded; preserves input order for deterministic matching)"), so `LambdaRecords` itself is deterministic. The non-determinism most likely enters via `ImageOrderer.Run` (`jb/src/core/Images/ImageOrderer.cs`) or upstream CLIP classification confidence — if GPU/DirectML inference has run-to-run floating-point variance for near-identical images, and the det-slot ranking for same-role candidates doesn't fall back to a fully deterministic secondary key (e.g. filename or original list order) when scores are equal/near-equal, ties resolve arbitrarily.

**What to do:**
1. Read `ImageOrderer.Run` and `jb/src/core/Images/Order/*.cs` (`DetSlotRule.cs`, `CandidateDetOrder.cs`, `DetOrderConfig.cs`) to find where same-role candidates are ranked/tie-broken.
2. Confirm or rule out CLIP/GPU floating-point non-determinism as the trigger.
3. Add a fully deterministic secondary/tertiary tie-break so equal/near-equal candidates always resolve the same way, every run.
4. Re-run `Invoke-CiPipeline.ps1 -Mode Full -Dataset CiMini` at least 5x consecutively and confirm identical det-slot assignment every time before recapturing `expected-manifest.json`.

**Acceptance:**
- 5 consecutive `-Mode Full -Dataset CiMini` runs (no code change between them) produce byte-identical `FinalFileName`/`DetOrder` for every image.
- `expected-manifest.json` can be captured once and trusted as a stable golden file.

**Files:** `jb/src/core/Images/ImageOrderer.cs`, `jb/src/core/Images/Order/*.cs`, `jb/src/core/Services/MatchingService.cs` (if root-caused to classification confidence).

### T-2830 · `_det#` numbering starts at det8 instead of the documented zero-based det0
**Status:** Ready | **Profile:** P1-feature-worker
**Found by:** [[T-2800]] end-to-end verification (2026-07-02).

**Problem:** CLAUDE.md's domain vocabulary states: "`_det#` — Zero-based image ordering suffix within a FamilyID (e.g. `_det0`, `_det1`)." The captured Full-mode CiMini manifest (2026-07-02) instead showed every family's first image landing on `_det8` — e.g. family `90861025` → `90861025_det8.jpg`, family `90861026` → `90861026_det8.jpg`, family `94613033`'s three images → det8/det9/det10. No family in the fixture ever produced `_det0` through `_det7`. This strongly suggests `DetOrderRules.json`'s per-product-type slot list is indexed against some fixed ordered list of ImageRoles, and slot 8 happens to be the first role CiMini's images actually match, rather than det numbering restarting at 0 per family as documented.

**Current vs. target behavior:**
- Current: the first assigned image in a family gets `_det8` (or higher); no image is ever `_det0`–`_det7`.
- Target (per CLAUDE.md domain vocabulary): det-slot numbering is zero-based *per family* — the first image in any family's det order should be `_det0`.

**What to do:**
1. Read `DetOrderRules.json` (`jb/src/core/Images/Order/`) and `ImageOrderer.Run`/`DetSlotRule.cs`/`CandidateDetOrder.cs` to find where the numeric det index is derived from ImageRole precedence.
2. Determine whether this is a genuine off-by-N indexing bug (e.g. enumerating a role list that includes roles never present in CiMini, with matched roles landing at index 8+) or a deliberate-but-undocumented convention — resolve via `jb/docs/PRISM-order-rename.md` (documented owner of `_det#`/ordering rules) and the `jbtodo.md` process if intent isn't already decided.
3. Fix the indexing (or correct the documentation, whichever is actually wrong) so det numbering matches the agreed convention.
4. Sequence after [[T-2820]] — recapturing `expected-manifest.json` to verify this fix needs deterministic det-slot assignment first.

**Acceptance:**
- First image in every family's det order is `_det0` (or CLAUDE.md's vocabulary is corrected to match the actual intended behavior, if that's the real resolution) — confirmed on CiMini.
- `jb/docs/PRISM-order-rename.md` and CLAUDE.md agree with implemented behavior.

**Files:** `jb/src/core/Images/Order/DetOrderRules.json`, `jb/src/core/Images/ImageOrderer.cs`, `jb/src/core/Images/Order/*.cs`, `jb/docs/PRISM-order-rename.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

### T-3200 · Close Services test coverage gaps: `IIngestService` IO/import path + `IArtifactStore`
**Status:** Ready | **Profile:** P1-feature-worker
**Tracks:** `jb/src/core/Services/jbtodo.md` (per-service test suite todo, triaged 2026-07-07).

**Problem:** Existing test folders already mirror stage boundaries by namespace (`PrismCoreTests.Transform`, `.Match`, `.Classify`, etc.), so per-stage isolation already works today via `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PrismCoreTests.<Stage>"` — no restructuring needed for that. But two service interfaces have no real coverage:
1. `IIngestService` — `Excel/` tests only exercise Excel parsing/IEM building (`ModelBuilder*Tests.cs`). Nothing tests the IO/import side documented in `jb/docs/PRISM-io-import.md` and implemented in `jb/src/core/IO/Import/Importer.cs` — multipart, ZIP, URL, and stream ingestion paths.
2. `IArtifactStore` — `LocalArtifactStore` (`jb/src/core/Services/LocalArtifactStore.cs`) has no direct unit tests; it's only exercised indirectly through `Export/ExporterTests.cs`.

**What to do:**
1. Add a `jb/src/tests/Prism.Core.Tests/Ingest/` folder (namespace `PrismCoreTests.Ingest`) covering `Importer.cs`'s multipart, ZIP, URL, and stream code paths — success and malformed-input cases for each.
2. Add direct unit tests for `LocalArtifactStore`: put/get roundtrip, missing-key behavior, concurrent writes if applicable.
3. Keep the existing per-folder namespace convention consistent (`PrismCoreTests.<Folder>`).

**Acceptance:**
- New tests fail if the corresponding production code is reverted (real behavioral coverage, not vacuous passes).
- `dotnet test jb/src/tests/Prism.Core.Tests/Prism.Core.Tests.csproj` green.

**Files:** `jb/src/tests/Prism.Core.Tests/` (new folders), `jb/src/core/IO/Import/Importer.cs`, `jb/src/core/Services/LocalArtifactStore.cs`.

### T-3300 · Validate and complete the Phase 2 distributed-services seam
**Status:** Ready | **Profile:** P4-critical-architecture
**Tracks:** `jb/src/core/Services/jbtodo.md` (per-service test suite todo, triaged 2026-07-07).

**Problem:** The physical separation of deployables described as "Phase 2" in `PipelineServices.cs` is largely already built, not merely planned:
- `PipelineServiceFactory.CreateFromEnvironment` already swaps any of Ingest/Matching/Generate/Transform for its HTTP client (`Http*Service` in `jb/src/core/Services/Http/`) when `PRISM_INGEST_URL` / `PRISM_MATCHING_URL` / `PRISM_GENERATE_URL` / `PRISM_TRANSFORM_URL` is set.
- `jb/src/services/Prism.ServiceHost/Program.cs` already exposes each service over HTTP independently via `PRISM_SERVICE=ingest|matching|generate|transform|upscale`.

None of this is validated end-to-end, and one known bug would break it in production:
1. No test exercises the actual HTTP round trip for any `Http*Service` client against `Prism.ServiceHost` — only in-process paths are tested today.
2. No CI job runs PRISM as actually-separate processes (multiple `Prism.ServiceHost` instances + URL env vars wired per service) — `ci.yml`/`full-pipeline.yml` only run the monolith API.
3. Known bug (`test/ci/README.md`): the API's in-process pipeline never calls `Upscaler_g_p_u.Initialize()` — only `Prism.ServiceHost` does — so Transform throws when it needs to upscale a small image on the monolith today, and the same gap would break a standalone Transform deployable.

**What to do:**
1. Fix the upscaler GPU-init gap in the API path (mirror what `Prism.ServiceHost/Program.cs` already does) so `-Mode Full` on CiMini goes green — this blocks trusting any distributed run too.
2. Add integration tests that stand up a `Prism.ServiceHost` instance (or in-memory `WebApplicationFactory`) per service and exercise each `Http*Service` client against it — real HTTP, not mocked.
3. Add a CI (or scheduled) job that runs the full pipeline with all four service URLs pointed at separate `Prism.ServiceHost` processes, and asserts it produces the same manifest as the in-process run on CiMini.
4. Only once distributed correctness is proven: split `Prism.Core.Tests` into per-service `.csproj` files along the existing namespace boundaries (`Transform/`, `Match/`, `Classify/`, `ImageNGP/`, `Order/`, `Rename/`, `Generate/`, `Export/`, plus [[T-3200]]'s new `Ingest/`). This step only pays off once steps 1-3 make Phase 2 real — do not do it speculatively first.

**Acceptance:**
- `-Mode Full -Dataset CiMini` passes both in-process and fully distributed (4 separate `Prism.ServiceHost` processes), producing identical `expected-manifest.json`.
- Each `Http*Service` has at least one real-HTTP-roundtrip test.
- Test projects physically split, mirroring the proven service boundaries.

**Files:** `jb/src/core/Services/PipelineServiceFactory.cs`, `jb/src/core/Services/Http/*.cs`, `jb/src/services/Prism.ServiceHost/Program.cs`, `jb/src/api/*` (upscaler init fix), `jb/src/tests/Prism.Core.Tests/*`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Verification Rules

- After project/solution setup: `dotnet build jb/src/PRISM.sln`, API/WPF run smoke, web `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build`.
- After each milestone: run relevant smoke and record result in milestone table.
- After todo/doc sync: `rg --files -g 'jbtodo.md' jb/src` and `rg -n "^- \[ \]" jb/src`.
- Before advancing milestones: `git status --short` to confirm edits stayed inside assigned ownership.
